## Getting Started
Use these instructions to get the project up and running.

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory, restore required packages by running:
```csharp
dotnet restore
```
3. Next, build the solution by running:
```csharp
dotnet build
```
4. Next, within the [InfoTrackBookingAPI](LoomAnalyticsBookingAPI) directory, launch the back end by running:
```csharp
dotnet run
```
5. Open http://localhost:5136/swagger in your browser to view and interact with the APIs. You can execute the API by sending the desired request body directly from the Swagger interface. Alternatively, you can run the API using the HTTP file located at InfoTrackBookingAPI/InfoTrackBookingAPI.http. Simply update the request as needed, and it should work.
